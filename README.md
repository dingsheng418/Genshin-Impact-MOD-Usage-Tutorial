Genshin Impact Mod Usage Tutorial

1. First, download GI-Model-Importer from GitHub.

Click "Releases" on the right to download the latest version.

3dmigoto-GIMI-for-development.zip is for developers. If you don't plan to create your own mods, download the 3dmigoto-GIMI-for-playing-mods.zip version below for faster download speeds.

2. After downloading, extract the files to your local drive, but do not extract them to the game folder. Otherwise, you will get a game data error message and be unable to play the game.

Open d3dx.ini with Notepad and search for `target =`.

Replace the address after `target =` with your game's address. Note that this is not the launcher's address. For the international version, it's `GenshinImpact.exe`, and for the Chinese version, it's `YuanShen.exe`. Save the changes after modification.

3. After modification, extract the downloaded mod files and place them in the `Mods` folder.

The folder name for `Mods` can be changed freely, but each character can only have one mod; duplicates are not allowed. Of course, if you don't mind the mess, you can also directly put the files from the folder into the Mods directory.

4. After doing this, you can run 3DMigoto Loader.exe, which will open a command prompt window.

This will not automatically launch the game; you need to launch the game manually. To change a mod, simply put the extracted mod folder into the mods directory, enter the game, and press F10 to load it. I don't know if this is an isolated case, but all the piano mods on my device require a game restart to take effect. You can try it yourself.
